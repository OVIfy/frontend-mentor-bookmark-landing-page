## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- javascript

### What I learned
i learnt how to implement sliders and a drop down menu, i tried building it without relying on google.
the slider was quite difficult to implement, i am not quite satisfied with how it works. i had to create a function that creates an animation for each case scenerio of the slider. currently the slider is quite static, what i mean is if i were to add a new slide i will have to create a new animation class for the slide.
```js
the fuction for moving the slide

function intToClass(previous,current){
    let str = ''
   switch (previous) {
    case 1:
         str = 'one'
        break;
    case 2:
        str = 'two'
        break;
    case 3:
        str = 'three'
        break;
    default:
        break;
   }

   switch (current) {
    case 1:
         str = `${str}-to-one`
        break;
    case 2:
        str = `${str}-to-two`
        break;
    case 3:
        str = `${str}-to-three`
        break;
    default:
        break;
   }
   return str;
}
```
### Continued development
i will continue to focus my attention more on how to build better slide menus and drop down menus
